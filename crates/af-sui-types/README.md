# af-sui-types

## About

<!-- cargo-rdme start -->

Aftermath's extensions to [`sui_sdk_types`].

Includes some types and constants from the original [`sui_types`] and [`move_core_types`] that
are not present in `sui_sdk_types`. This crate also re-exports a lot of the types in
`sui_sdk_types`.

This crate was originally conceived with the following objectives:
- [`serde`] compatibility with the full Sui checkpoint data
- avoiding dynamic error types so that callers could match against errors and react accordingly
- using a minimal set of dependencies
- [SemVer](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/semver.html) compatibility

<div class="warning">

The long-term plan is to deprecate most of this in favor of [`sui_sdk_types`]. However, there
are some types in that crate that don't expose all of the attributes/methods we need yet.
